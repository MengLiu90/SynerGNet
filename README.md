# SynerGNet
SynerGNet is a machine learning tool to predict synergy effects of anti-cancer drug combinations. Given the gene expression, copy number variation, mutaion types, and gene ontology terms of the cell lines and drug-protein association scores of the paired drugs, the model is able to predict whether the paried drugs are synergistic or antagnistic against the cancer cell line.
